## Map Creation

[donjon.bin.sh](https://donjon.bin.sh) - Many random generation resources.

[Dungeon Scrawl](https://dungeonscrawl.com) - Dungeon map making tool. Nice, but most features have crept over a paywall. Subscription is a little pricey for casual use.

[RPG Map Editor II](https://deepnight.net/tools/rpg-map) - Intuitive pixel style software for creating dungeon, building and town maps. Can import from Procgen Arcana. No longer in development and assets are few, however you can create your own.

[Watabou's Procgen Arcana](https://watabou.github.io) - Open resource for generating random maps with markup. Regularly updated.

[Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com) - Complex map creation tool.

[Dungeon Map Doodler](https://dungeonmapdoodler.com) - Map creation tool with a hand-drawn asthetic.

## Misc Tools

[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com) - Used for quickly sharing ideas.

[Google Slides](https://slides.google.com) - Used to quickly share ideas if the person didn't understand what you wrote in the doc and needs you to literally draw them a diagram.

[Pixlr AI Image Generator](https://pixlr.com/image-generator) - Used to create pictures for your campaign if you can't draw and don't have any artistic friends to give you a hand.

[Pixlr Express](http://pixlr.com/express) - Used to draw over the AI art to make you feel less guilty about using AI art.

[Krita](https://krita.org) - Used when you realise Pixlr Express is a bit crap and you need a proper art app if you want to make anything decent.
