# Background Notes

The Lost Kingdom of Omera is about an ancient mythical magical kingdom that once existed thousands of years ago. It was more advanced than the current world which is in a decline, with few major cities and disparate settlements. No magic exists in the present, or so it appears.

A great cataclysm occured when the ancient land of Omera was buried under the remains of the land of Suriia. Suriia was a magical land that once existed to the north. It was the ancient land of the tribal Surii. The elves of Omera had built creat cities and developed a long culture but they feared the primative Surii. The Surii, being a younger race from a more primal area of the world had stronger magic than the elves. who had spent theirs over the millennia building a great empire. Once the elves had also been simple tribal people, however the whisperings of the demon Lukhat had inspired them to reach for more power. They tried to tame and enslave the primative Surii, who fought back ferociously. The ancient Emperor Elkon VII, who had secretly been reincarnated for thousands of years by Lukhat in the form of his advisor Telgon, wanted to destroy the Suuri entirely. His people, feeling he was out of control, tried to usurp him. Elkon relented, but was slain by Lukhat who took over his form. He used forbidden demonic magic to force both of the worlds moons to create a double eclipse that would cause a rent into the dark realm and pull all the primal life-force from Suriia turning it to dark energy that he could harness to become a god.

In Suriia, a great conclave of druids combined their strength to stop Lukhat taking the life-force from the land, but their power wasn't enough and the land of Suriia was destroyed. Meanwhile, in Omera, a group of heroes attacked Lukhat, he fought them off, but while weakened some Omerani mages were able to steal his scepter. While his guards searched for the scepter, he struggled to control the rift. A hero was able to injure him and he lost control. The conjuction broke and the rift closed and the primal magical life-force of Suriia and the dark energies of the dark realm were released and were drawn into Lukhat's scepter that had been taken from the city. The debris from the destroyed lands of Suuria fell upon Omera, burying it forever along with most of it's people and Lukhat, now trapped in the dead form of the kingdoms emperor.

Suriia was left a desert and the survivng people scattered along with the remaining elves of Omera. Overtime a forest grew across the buried Omera, hiding it's secrets. The humans of Suriia built new kingdoms on the remains. The elves became reclusive, hiding in the forests and sticking to the old ways before Lukhat's corruption. The Lost Kingdom of Omera and it's magic became a myth. However, deep underground Lukhat lies buried, dreaming of escape.

The players know none of this of course, they are more concerned with finding lost piglets.

**Players:** 1-4

## Modules

### The Escaped Pig

*Tam has lost a pig. It ran off towards the river. You can have an old sword if you catch it. Just don't go near the caves...*

The pig has gone into the cave, of course the kids will follow.

Door puzzle requires a set of coloured stones to be inserted.

### The Hole

*The bucket fell into the well again. Boab can make another one when he has the time. Just don't try to climb down and get it. Remember what happened to Kort...*

Kids can climb down a rope. There is a crack in the wall leading to a ruined chamber. A set of magical rings can be found.

### The Boy who cried Wolf.

*Before he went missing, Boab's boy Jeth said he saw eyes watching him at night in the north field. Boab has been sad since. What happend to the boy?*

The boy followed a wolf who was attacking his dad's cattle to kill it and earn his dad's respect. He got bit and became a werewolf. Urnst knows and keeps it a secret. Jeth comes on his human days for supplies and in return helps Urnst with his field. He keeps the other wolves from bothering the village.

### The Haunted Tower

*The old watchtower has stood looking over the region for as long as people have lived here. No-one remember who built it or why. It's supposed to be haunted...*

### The Town

*Tam says he'll take the kids to town for the first time. It's a long journey through the old forest road. Anything could happen...*

## NPCs

Main kid lives with uncle Tam. Tam is a grumpy old man who seems to care more for his pigs than the kid. Truth is he has lost too much and it has left him broken. He worries that one day he will lose the kid too. It's easier to lose pigs.

Families can be assigned/created for other players.

**Storyteller** - kids usually find him in the square. He tells stories about the past. The villagers thinks it's all made up. Some is, but not all. 

**Old Megrin** - She grows herbs. The kids like her but think she is a witch.

**Tobin** - Grows turnips. Doesn't like kids. He is helped by his son, Kort, who is a bit simple after falling down the well as a child.

Other kids parents.

Village is nestled in a large copse of trees around an old road that leads between the forest path and the downs. An ancient watchtower overlooks the area from a hill inside the forest. It's said to be haunted. It doesn't date from the time of Omera, but from the wars after. Towards the edge of the forest are some cliffs that drop down to the river. Some caves exist there. Previously used by smugglers. The kids mustn't go there as it could contain bandits or worse. Not that they have many bandits in the area as there is not much to steal.

Kort says there are voices in the well.

Megrin says there are Nixies in the forest who will lead you to your doom. Probably Nixies down the well.

It is said that an old wizard lives in a cave in the downs.

Boab keeps a few goats. He used to keep cows but something in the north field spooked them and their milk turned, so they got ate. Megrin says it was Nixies, Boab says it was goblins. Before he went missing, Boab's son Jeth, said he saw glowing eyes in the north field at night. Boab doesn't talk about his son. No-one does.

Urnst grows wheat in the north field now. He said there is nothing there. He sells most of his wheat in the town. He makes a lot of wheat. It's a wonder how he harvests it all on his own. He has no family, though it is said he has people in the town.

## AREA

The ruins of the mythical lost city are actually under the enchanted forest. They are mostly underground as debris from the cataclysm 1200 years ago buried the city. Magic seeping through the ground has enhanted the forest. Even the bandits largely stick to the old trade road, cleared 500 years ago by King Ivreth IV and largely unused since the fall of the kingdom 150 years previously, the increse in bandit activity and the opening of the coastal routes.
