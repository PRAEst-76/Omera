# Frequently Asked Questions

*Why D&D? Why not one of the other popular rules systems like Pathfinder?*

Dungeons & Dragons is the most popular role-playing system in the world, the one people are most likely to be familiar with. That said, I used it largely because it's what I play the most, however Omera, like any RPG system campaign or module, can be tailored to just about any rule system out there with a little work.
