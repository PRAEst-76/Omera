## BOAB

Human - Male - Lvl 5

Goat herd. Keeps the goats in a paddock behind his house. For many years he kept cows, but one morning the cows appeared spooked. Their milk curdled. His son said he though he saw a wolf. Despite his father's warning the boy took off to hunt the wolf. He was never seen again. Boab won't talk about it.
