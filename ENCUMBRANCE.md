# Encumbrance

![Card Wallet](images/CardWallet.png)

To simplify encumbrance I've decided that characters can only carry what they can fit in their backpack. To make this practical I've designed a "backpack" card wallet. It may hold 8-10 cards. This will not include anything "worn" and this includes one weapon. Additional weapons have to be stored in the "backpack".

Still wondering what do do with the "worn" cards. A seperate wallet?
