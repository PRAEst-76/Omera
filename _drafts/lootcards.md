## Loot Cards

![Loot Cards]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cards.png)

To make things more tactile I've oped to do away with a written inventory and create cards to reprisent items the players aquire during their game. These can also be shuffled by the DM to deal out random loot.

### Work in Progress

I've initially started on a low level pack for the first module. Basic stuff lvl 1 adventurers might need or come across. Trash basically... but beggars can't be choosers.

[Canva Link for Card Pack One](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGwKx_J5Fk/9ovlxCQ4nNbwwjjuS0yESw/view?utm_content=DAGwKx_J5Fk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=hfc4094d7dc)

Canva lets you export to PDF with crop-marks and bleed, however Canva doesn't support crop-marks and bleed, so it just sticks them wherever. I have left an area around each card to allow for cropping.
