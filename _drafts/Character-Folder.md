While trying to adjust the layout of the chgaracter sheet I figured that the equipment cards a player may have would need to be kept somewhere, so I designed a card wallet shaped like a backpack. I've now redesigned the Character Sheet into a Character Folder and the "backpack" can be glued inside of.
