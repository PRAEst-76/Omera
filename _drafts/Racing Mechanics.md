## {{ post.title }}

I've written a part of a quest where characters have to do some barrel racing down an underwater river. I did this without knowing how i would manage it, so I've started researching how others have managed racing.

[r/DMAcademy:  Does anyone know of any good racing mechanics for 5e?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/x96b0o/does_anyone_know_of_any_good_racing_mechanics_for/)

The gist seems to be to use a modified chase mechanics. What are chase mechanics I hear you ask? Well, I've had no idea. Never chased or been chased in a desktop roleplaying session. Or if I have I've done it without knowing and probably performed very poorly.

From what I've discovered the standard chase rules doe D&D are considered to be quite dull and people usually have to improvise to make it interesting.

So here goes: characters are racing down a river current, in barrels. they have a plank to use as an oar. _They are in barrels._ This is not going to be The Fast & The Furious. If it's not going to be thrilling, then it has to be at least fun. Barrels aren't going to be very manouverable. Players can maybe adjust their bodyweight to direct the barrel somewhat. They can use the "oar" to help manouver or speed up. As they are up against goblins I'd expect the rules of the race to be minimal, and use of oars to push an opponents barrel could be an option.

The race will be short, given the length of the river between the starting point (a makeshift bridge near the back of the cave) and the end point (the shallows at the opening to the cave outside). This also stops it getting too tedious. I was thinking perhaps three or four rounds.

The current and eddies can be managed with rice rolls each round. 

So...

Round One
    River - 1d6
        1 - Weak Left
        2 - Weak Right
        3 - Left
        4 - Right
        5 - Strong Left
        6 - Strong Right
