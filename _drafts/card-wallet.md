## The Card Wallet

![Card Wallet]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CardWallet.png)

To simplify encumbrance I've decided that characters can only carry what they can fit in their backpack. To make this practical I've designed a "backpack" card wallet. It may hold 8-10 cards. This will not include anything "worn" by the character and the weapon they have ready. Additional weapons have to be stored in the "backpack".

Still wondering what do do with the "equipped" cards. A seperate wallet? Perhaps a clear plastic card window?
