# The Lost Kingdom of Omera

An attempt to create a D&D campaign for very young players (ie, my six year old daughter and her friends). Simple text and aids, child-friendly storylines, focus on puzzle solving and lateral thinking and little combat. Combat should be largly avoidable. Players should receive XP for puzzle solving and completing quests and not combat.

Players will start with little knowledge of the world. Their village is largely isolated. They will learn lore as they go which will be a reward.

## Introduction

_The lost kingdom of Omera has become a myth. A lost age of magic and enlightement before the dark era, before the clash of kings, before the great forest spread across the ruins.
In the small village of Harwich a storyteller entertains the childtren with tales of these times and inspires in their minds hopes and dreams that may change the world forever._

## How to Play

Game is loosely based on D&D 5th Ed will heavily simplified rules.

Players will all start in the tiny village of Harwich. They are little more than adventurous village kids and will have little knowledge of the world. Some fanciful backstory will be given in the form of stories from the Storyteller character.

They start will no weapons or armour initially and will do basic quests given by townsfolk to raise money and experience.

### Encounters

Monster encounters will be few and can be handled with problem solving. Any combat will be non-fatal. characters reaching 0 hit points will run away. Fleeing characters will drop 1d4 items and 1d4 X lvl gold. This applies to players and NPCs.

### Equipment

Equipment will be on picture cards to limit the amount of text young players will need to read. It will just be assumed that players have the basics, such as a backpack, clothes, camping equipment and food. 

### Rest and Recuperation 

Characters can restore Health Points (HP) by resting or consuming a Health Potion. All the characters HP will be restored. Characters need to be in a friendly area to rest and need to rest overnight.
