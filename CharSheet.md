# Character Sheet

![Picture of the Character Sheet](SimpleCharacterSheetv0.4.png)

I've tried to make the character sheet as simple as possible. Icons to make it easier to recognise what each entry reprisents. It has the basic ability scores and modifiers, HP and AC, Speed, and a box for the character name. There is also a blank space where the player can sketch their character.

The plan was that these would be laminated, with number stickers for the abilities, vinyl dots that reprisent the HP that can be removed and re-added depending on the characters status, and a writable sticker for the name and sketch.

No race is included as at the beginning all players are humans from a human village just to keep things simple. Later as the group come across non-humans there is the option for the players to start non-human characters. At this point a sticker reprisenting a race would be stuck on the card.
