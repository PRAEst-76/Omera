A small village located in the Heartlands, between the enchanted forest and the south downs on the old trade road between the town of Dunwell and the former settlements on the coast.

The village is very small and has no inn or trading post. Urnst is the closest thing to a trader. Tam the pig-farmer doubles up as the local blacksmith. Megrin is the local healer.
