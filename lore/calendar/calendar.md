# Calendar

The current calendar begins after the dark age following the cataclysm. The first month is called Newdawn as it symbolises the start of the year after the long dark winter. The months were determined given the new year length and the arrival of the new moon Tynne. The weekdays are derivations of the ancient pre-cataclysm weekdays named after ancient forgotton gods.
