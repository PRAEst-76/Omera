## Character Sheet

![Character Sheet]({{ site.url}}/{{ site.baseurl }}/images/SimpleCharacterSheetv0.8.png)

I've been working on a character sheet. I've considered something colourful, perhaps laminated that players can write on and wipe off. Or perhaps fill using re-usable stickers. I like this idea but will probably make a b&w photocopyable sheet for traditional penciling.
