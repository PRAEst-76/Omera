To make things more tactile I've oped to do away with a written inventory and create cards to reprisent items the players aquire during their game. These can also be shuffled by the DM to deal out random loot.

I've initially started on a low level pack for the first module. Basic stuff lvl 1 adventurers might need or come across. Trash basically... but beggars can't be choosers.

[Canva Link for Card Pack One](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGwKx_J5Fk/vtpJrH37aBqG3ktHuO6mGw/edit?utm_content=DAGwKx_J5Fk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

Note: Canva lets you export to PDF with crop-marks and bleed, however Canva doesn't support crop-marks and bleed, so it just sticks them wherever. Thus, I have left an area around each card to allow for cropping. I may add proper crop marks in the future for people who wish to print these out.
