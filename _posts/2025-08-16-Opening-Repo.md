# Opening the Repository

I've been working on this for a while and as a "neuro-divergent" individual, it's hard sometimes to get motivation or see projects clearly.

Having fresh eyes and exernal encouragment helps. Hence I'm giving the link to this repository out so people can see what I'm doing and offer advice and suggestions etc. I'm sure I'm not the only person wanting a way to introduce their kids to this wonderful hobby (I know I'm not as I've googled and many people have done this sort of thing).
