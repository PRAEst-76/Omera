## Encounters

Encounters in omera can mean various things; the party have 'encountered' an NPC or obstacle and need to deal with it. In general D&D this usually means an NPC and the 'dealing with it' part usually involves hitting it until it's no longer an obsticle.

In Omera we want to reduce the amount of violent solutions in favour of more lateral thinking, co-operation and puzzle solving. Some encounters may still involve hitting things, but this should be kept at a minimum.

In the first module our heroes are searching for a missing piglet, and find it is being held by a goblin in a cave. They could try to attack the goblin, but if they talk to the goblin they will find he would rather have some seedcake. Bringing him some will let the party exchange it for the piglet.
