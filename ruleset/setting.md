## Setting

Long ago, the magical kingdom of Omera disappeared beneath a great enchanted forest. Now, children explore the forest, discover hidden ruins, and help friendly people and animals. The land is full of secrets and magic waiting to be found!

Players begin in the small village of Harwich, doing jobs for the locals before venturing out into the world.

### Places to Explore

- **Enchanted Forest**: Sprawling trees, sparkling streams, and mysterious ruins. Wild magic perpetuates the forest. It is a place of wonder and danger.
- **Heartlands**: Open plains and meadows, quaint farms and eerie ruins.
- **Desert of Suriia**: A huge desert to the north, home to an ancient hardy people.

### People to Meet

- **Tam**: A grizzled old farmer, but buried beneath his weather exterior is a heart of gold. He acts like a surrogate father to the players.
- **Megrin**: Knows all about the forestâ€™s plants and animals. Takes can of the villagers with her herbs and poltices. Some think her a witch.
- **Boab**: Always working hard.
- **The Storyteller**: Ancient and full of tales.
