## Introduction

The Lost Kingdom of Omera is a campaign and simplified ruleset for Dungeons & Dragons 5 Edition aimed at introducing younger players (ages 6 and up) to the game.

Modules or Chapters are designed to be simplified and aimed towards roleplaying, problem solving and encouraging the use of imagination.

The game uses a simplified character sheet using icons to reprisent the attributes. Character inventory is reprisented by equipment cards. Character gold is represented using plastic coins of varying amounts. This aims for a more tactile feel to the game.

Gameplay itself is largely descriptive, using some maps and visual aids to assist, but largely attempting to encourage players to use their imagination rather than relying on playing pieces.

Note: Eventually I will compile eveything into a rulebook or guide, but for the time being, barely cohesive scribbles on scraps of paper and sketches on beermats will have to suffice.
