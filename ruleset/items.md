## Items

Omera uses/can use any items that exist within D&D. However I wish to keep things simple and only use plot-relevant gear, doing away with items such as ammo, rations, camping gear, spell components etc, that might over-complicate play for young players. It should be assumed that player characters are carryibng the basic necessities. 

As state elsewhere, aquirable items are on cards.
