## Items

Omera uses/can use any items that exist within D&D. However I wish to keep things simple and only use plot-relevant gear, doing away with items such as ammo, rations, camping gear, spell components etc, that might over-complicate play for young players. It should be assumed that player characters are carryibng the basic necessities. 

As state elsewhere, aquirable items are on cards.

Basic equipment can be purchased or found during play. Loot can be determined in advance or drawn randomly if using the loot cards.
