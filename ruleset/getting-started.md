## Getting Started

The game is meant for 2-6 players plus a dungeon master. While this is an implimentation of Dungeons & Dragons core rules aimed at players aged 6-8 it is intended to be played with an older Dungeon Master.

Each player will be given a character sheet which the DM can help them fill in using the [basic D&D rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/creating-a-character#ChooseaCharacterSheet).
